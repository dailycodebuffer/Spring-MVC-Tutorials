# Spring-MVC-Tutorials

Java and Spring Tutorials
================

This project is **a collection of small and focused tutorials** - each covering a single and well defined area of development in the Java ecosystem.

Building the project
====================
To do the full build, do: `mvn clean install`


Building a single module
====================
To build a specific module run the command: `mvn clean install` in the module directory


Running a Spring Boot module
====================
To run a Spring Boot module run the command: `mvn spring-boot:run` in the module directory


Working with the IDE
====================
This repo contains a large number of modules. 
When you're working with an individual module, there's no need to import all of them (or build all of them) - you can simply import that particular module in either Eclipse or IntelliJ.
